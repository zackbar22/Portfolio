## About Me
My name is Zack Barnett, I am a Junior Certified in the Computer Science Major with a Minor in Progress in Mathmatics at Washington State University Honors College. I'm a self-motivated and sociable individual who excells when working with others. I'm looking to gain experience in a variety of feilds in order to decide which aspect of Computer Science I wish to specialize in. My primary interestes and areas of experience include Software Development, Security, Backend Web Development, and Data Analytics.

## Projects

[CS 360 Final Project](https://github.com/zackbar22/CS_360_final_project) This Final Project is a fully Linux recognizable filing system which allocates, deallocates, and manipulates memory on a virtual disk via INODES and memory blocks to allow the user to create and traverse multiple level directories and files. The user can also perform numerous Linux commands to alter or show contents and locations of directories and files. Base Code and advisment given by my CS 360 Professor Kung-Chi Wang.

[Graph Theory Visual Application](https://github.com/zackbar22/Graph_Theory_Application) This application gives you a canvas to create, connect, and move around vertices to help visualize graphs that can be used in graph theory classes. You have the ability to connect multiple vertices together with lines as well as remove connected veritices. You can change the color of vertices, add parallel edges, and test whether the graph is bipartisan or not. Information on the total number of vertices and total degree of the graph is displayed in the top left of the window, and the number adjust appropriately as you change the graph.   

[Shopping Cart Trend Finder](https://github.com/zackbar22/Shopping_Cart_Trends) This program takes a text file with numerous lines of shopping cart items and traverses through the data using an A-Priori algorithm to find pairs of items frequently bought together, and groups of three items frequently bought together given a threshold of how many apperiences is considered frequent. The program then determines the percent chance of an item being bought given that they have already bought a different item, and prints the top 5 percents to a txt file. The practical usage of this program is to be used as an algorithm to suggest shopping items to customers based off of what is in their cart or what they've already bought.
